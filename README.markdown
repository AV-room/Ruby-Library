Ruby API Library for Fat Zebra
==============================

Further (better) readme content coming soon - I promise!

General Usage:

 1. Add the gem to your project (i.e. Gemfile or otherwise)
 2. Create a new FatZebra::Gateway object, and pass it your username, token, and true or false for using test mode.
 4. Call the purchase() method on the gateway object.
 5. Examine the result.

More details to follow (structure of request/response objects etc).
